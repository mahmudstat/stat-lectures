These are chiefly meant for being used as reference materials, which, together with the lectures slides, make for a more matured system of learning. See the lecture presentations here This website is created with the help of Rstudio IDE using the Rpackage bookdown. **If you find any mistakes or have any suggestions, please let me know You can learn more about me here and about my writings on statistics, data science, and linux here.
