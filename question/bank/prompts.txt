4. pdflatex all_questions.tex

I have some question on a google sheet, where there latex expressions. sl question type noq (no of questions) field chapter topic qcat (Question Category) are the columns.

A sample row

1\question \textbf{Three objects can be placed in 2 positions in -- ways.}

\choice{3}{4}{6}{8}{c}, mcq,1,probability,probability,permutation,single

I want to make a pdf using them in latex. Filed would become PART, chapter \section, topic \subsection, qcat \subsubsection.
