  \item What does $P(A) = 0$ imply? \hfill 1
  \item
In how many ways can 3 students be chosen from a class of 20 students? \hfill 2
    \item  
	What is the probability that two marbles are yellow and one green? \hfill 3
    \item
	Determine the probability that the marbles are the same color. \hfill 4

         \item
	  \textbf{Ratul and Tomal both have an unbiased die. Each has randomly thrown their die once.} 
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
	What are mutually exclusive events? \hfill 1
	\item When is the equation $P(A \cup B = P(A) + P(B)$ true? Explain briefly. \hfill 2
    \item  
	From the stem, what is the probability that the sum of numbers appearing
	 on the dice is greater\\ than 8? \hfill 3
    \item
	Examine the statement: the probabilities of getting the sum less than 6 and greater 
	than 6 are \\ equal. \hfill 4
