# Linear Equations in One Variable

## Topics

- Equations
- Linear Equations

## Linear Equations

- ax + by  = c (two variables)
- ax + by + cz = d (3 variables)

## Visual Equations

## Rules of Equation

<div class="container">
<div class="col">
Same amount can be 

- added
- subtracted
- multiplied
- divided

on both side

</div>
</div>

## Examples of Rules

- x + 2 = 6
- x - 4 = 1
- 4x + 10 = 22
- $12x = 14$ from $\frac{3x}{2}=\frac74$
- $3x+2=2x+1$ from $5(3x+2)=5(2x+1)$

# Individual Tasks

> - What is the number when adding 5 to the double of it will give the sum 25?
> - Sum of two numbers is 55 and 5 times the bigger number is equal to 6 times the
smaller number. Find the two numbers.
> - Gita, Rita and Mita together have 180 taka. Gita has 6 taka less than Rita and
Mita has 12 taka more. Determine who has what amount?
