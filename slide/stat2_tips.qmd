## Chapter 01: Introduction to Probability

- $^6C_3 = \frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!}$; use calculator to save time 

## Random Variable

- Random variable: a variable whose outcomes are associated with probability (having no sure-fire outcome) 
- Marginal vs joint events ([see here](https://docs.statmania.info/slide/02-random-variable.html#/joint-marginal-conditional-revisited))
- Marginals probabilities (P(X)) are obtained by adding joint probabilities (P(x,y))
- If conditional probability is $P(X|Y), P(X|0) = P(X|y=0)$
- $P(X|0)$ means if y = 0, what is probability of x?


## Expetation

- $V(X) < SD(X)$ if $0 \lt V(X) \lt 1$ or $V(X)$ is greater


## Binomial Distribution

- - To find $P(X\ge 3); n=15$, use $1-P(X \lt3)$ or calculator (if you don't have computer with you)
