# Concept of Vital Statistics

<script>
function klikaj(i) {
    document.getElementById(i).style.visibility='visible';
}
</script>

That branch of biometry which deals with data and laws of human mortality, morbidity, and demography.

## Rate vs Ratio

## Dependency Ratio 

<div class="container">
<div class="col">
$$d = \frac{P_{0-14}+P_{65+}}{P_{15-64}}\times100$$
Where

- $P_{0-14}$ = The no. of children aged between 0 & 14
- $P_{65+}$ = The no. of people aged 65 or older
- $P_{15-64}$ = The no. of people aged between 15 and 64
</div>
<div class="col">
> - $d = 103\%$ means there are 103 dependents for every 100 working-age people

> - $d = 70\%$ means there 70 dependents for every 100 working-age people
</div>
</div>


## DR Example

| Age Group           | Population (millions) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| 0-14 (Youth)        | 40                     |
| 15-64 (Working-Age) | 120                    |
| 65+ (Elderly)       | 20                     |

Find the Dependency Ratio and explain

<div onclick="klikaj('rad1')"><span>Reveal Answer</span></div>
<div id="rad1" style="visibility: hidden">
\[
\text{Dependency Ratio} = \left( \frac{\text{Youth} + \text{Elderly}}{\text{Working-age population}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Dependency Ratio} = \left( \frac{40 + 20}{120} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{60}{120} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
\]
</div>



## DR Insight

Dependency Ratios of two different cities are 

$d_1 = 101\%$ and $d_2 = 98/%$

i. Which city has more dependent people than?
2. Write the interpretation of each value.

## Sex Ratio 

$SR = \frac MF \times 100$

Suppose a town has the following population data:

- **Males**: 52,000

- **Females**: 50,000

\[
\text{Sex Ratio} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Males}}{\text{Number of Females}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Sex Ratio} = \left( \frac{52,000}{50,000} \right) \times 100 = 104
\]

## SR Explanation

In this example, the sex ratio is 104, which indicates that there are 104 males for every 100 females in the town.

> - IF SR = 95, what does it mean?

## Population Density

$D = \frac PA$

P = Density

A = Area

## Crude Birth Rate

$CBR = \frac BP\times 100$

B = Total no. of alive children in a year

P = Average population of that region in that time

## General Fertility Rate

$\displaystyle GFR = \frac{B}{F_{15-49}}\times 1000$

B = Total number of live births in a year

$F_{15-49}$ = Total number of women in reproductive age group (15-49)

## Age-Specific Fertility Rate

$\displaystyle ASFR_i = \frac{B_i}{F_i}\times 1000$

$B_i$ = Total number of live births in a year by the women in ith age group

$F_i$ = No. of women in ith age group

## Total Fertility Rate

Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of a population is the average number of children that are born to a woman over her lifetime if:

i. they were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) through their lifetime.
ii. they were to live from birth until the end of their reproductive life.

$\displaystyle TFR = 5 \sum_{i=1}^7ASFR_i = 5 \sum_{i=1}^7 \frac{B_i}{F_i}\times 1000$

5 for class interval

## Gross Reproduction Rate

$\displaystyle GRR = 5 \sum_{i=1}^7\frac{G_i}{F_i}\times 1000$

$G_i =$ Total number of girl babies born in a year by the women in ith age group

## Net Reproduction Rate

$\displaystyle NRR = 5 \sum_{i=1}^7\frac{G_i}{F_i}\times S_i\times 1000$

$S_i =$ Survival rate of women of reproductive age group (15-49)

## Net Fertility Rate

$\displaystyle NFR = 5 \sum_{i=1}^7\frac{B_i}{F_i}\times S_i\times 1000$

## Implications

> - GRR > 1: Number of potent women increasing
> - GRR = 1: Number of potent women remains constant. There is no change in population
> - NRR > 1: The number of potent women more than that of previous year; population increasing
> - NRR = 1: No change in population
> - GRR = NRR: No new-born girls dies before reaching last potent age

# Natural Growth Rate (NGR)

NGR = CBR - CDR

$\displaystyle \frac BP \times 1000-\frac DP \times 1000 = \frac {B-D}P \times 1000$

# Growths

## Geometric Growth

$P_o =$ Initial population

$P_n =$ Final population

$n =$ Number of period (year, month, etc)

$r =$ Rate of increase

> - Population after 1 year, $P_1 = P_o + P_or = P_o(1+r)$
> - Population after 2 years, $P_2 = P_1 + P_1r = P_1(1+r) = P_o(1+r)^2$
> - Population after n years, $P_n = P_o(1+r)^n$

## Growth Problems

- Time required for population to get doubled/tripled in certain rate
- Rate required for population to get doubled/tripled in certain time

## Exponential Growth 

Geometric: $P_n = P_o(1+r)^n$

If n is fragmented in smaller periods

Like 100 % in 1 year $\rightarrow$ 50 % in each half-year

$P_n = P_o(1+\frac{r}{n})^n$
