![](img/Simple_random_sampling.png)

## Population

> - Finite: people in Dhaka
> - Infinite: hairs in head, fish in pacific ocean, stars

## Terms

> - Sample size
> - Parameter: Population characteristic (such as $\sigma$)
> - Statistics: Sample characteristic ($\bar x, sd$)

## Census vs Sample Survey

Disadvantages of census:

> - Time
> - Cost
> - Quality
> - Accuracy
> - Multi-purpose

# Samplig Methods

> - Probability/Random sampling
> - Non-probability sampling

## Random sampling

> - Simple Random (SRS)
> - Systematic Sampling
> - Stratified Sampling
> - Cluster Sampling

## SRS

> - Lottery method
> - Remainder approach
> - Quitient approach

## Remainder approach

> - 1. N = 30 (digit d =2)
> - 2. N' = Highest d-digit number = 90
> - 3. Choose a random number between 1 and N' (90), say 65
> - 4. Divide by N (30) and select the Rth item (R = Remainder = 25)
> - 5. Repeat (3-4)
