# First Paper

# Finding Averages

Determination of Arithmetic Mean, Combined Arithmetic Mean, Geometric Mean, and Harmonic from Grouped and Ungrouped Data

# Construction of Histogram and Ogive

Name: Do

Problem: Annual profits (BDT hundred thousands) made by 115 firms are given below:

| Profit (BDT) | 25-30 | 30-35 | 35-40 | 40-45 | 45-50 | 50-55 | 55-60 |
|:------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| No. of Firms |   5   |   16  |   26  |   30  |   20  |   12  |   6   |

> - Make a histogram and Ogive from the following data and explain.

## Theory

Continuous class intervals are used for constructing histogram. Discrete class intervals are converted in the following way:

| Discrete | Continuous |
|:--------:|:----------:|
|   11-15  |  10.5-15.5 |
|   16-20  |  15.5-20.5 |

## Others

- Equipments
- Estimation (table for Ogive - cumulative frequency)

## Interpretation (Histogram)

> - Most firms earned ---
> - Few firms earned --
> - Highest profits are earned by ---
> - Lowest firms are earned by ---
> - Average profits are ---
> - Pattern of frequency 

## Interpretation (Ogive)

> - 16 firms earned 35,00,000 or less 
> - Few more like this

# Partition Values from Ogive

Name: Determination of Quartiles, Deciles, and Percentiles Using Ogive

Problem: Temperatures (in Â°C) of 100 cities around the world are given below:

| Temperature | 0-5 | 5-10 | 10-15 | 15-20 | 20-25 | 25-30 | 30-35 | 35-40 |
|:-----------:|:---:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|  Frequency  |  8  |  11  |   13  |   20  |   23  |   12  |   8   |   5   |

Draw an Ogive and determine the Quartlies, 7th Decile, 35th Percentiles from the data and explain.
