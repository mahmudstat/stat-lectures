# Determination of Arithmetic Mean, Combined Arithmetic Mean, Geometrci Mean, and Harmonic Mean from Grouped and Ungrouped Data.

# Construction of Histogram and Ogive

## Problem

Given below are daily wages of 30 workers in an agency. 

\begin{center}
\textbf{515, 833, 938, 511, 960, 968, 542, 842, 767, 694, 674, 955, 675, 972, 501, 987, 708, 846, 568, 721, 592, 867, 644, 966, 663, 551, 746, 942, 760, 601}
\end{center}

Draw a Histogram and an Ogive from the data and interpret.

## Solution

### Theory

A histogram is constructed from a frequency distribution with continuous class intervals. The frequencies corresponding to different classes are shown on the axis as bars, leaving no space or gap between the bars. 

# Determination of Quartiles, Deciles, and Percentiles

## Problem

Given below are temperatures (in degree Celsius) of a city in 30 random days in a year. 

\begin{center}
33.86, 34.83, 35.59, 31.66, 26.31, 26.90, 33.10, 26.52, 35.17, 25.21, 25.28, 28.38, 29.62, 30.69, 32.72, 30.00, 30.14, 27.97, 28.45, 35.93, 33.34, 29.07, 34.00, 27.55, 34.03, 33.76, 29.48, 31.24, 33.79, 33.41
\end{center}

Find the quartiles, 4th and 7th Decile, and 35th \& 87th Percentiles from the data and interpret. 

## Solution

### Theory

Determination of First Quartile

Let n = no. of observations

If n = odd

Location of first quartile = $\frac{n+1}{4}$th item 

Location of 2nd quartile = $\frac{2(n+1)}{4}$th item 

Other quantiles are determined in the same way. 

If n = even

Location of first quartile = $\frac{\frac n4 th + \frac{(n+1)}4th}{2}$

Location of 2nd quartile = $\frac{\frac {2n}4 th + \frac{2(n+1)}4th}{2}$

Other quantiles are determined similarly. 

The general formula to find the ith quantile, which divides the dataset into k parts.

\[
Q_i = \frac{i(n+1)}{k}th; \text{if n is odd}
\]

\[
Q_i = \frac{\frac{in}{k}th+(\frac{in}{k}+1)th}{2}; \text{if n is even}
\]


# Solution of Different Types of Problems Using Histogram and Ogive

## Problem 

The following are the scores of 80 applicants in a screening test given by an institution. 
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
Score & 45-49 & 50-54 & 55-59 & 60-64 & 65-69 & 70-74 & 75-79 & 80-84 & 84-89 & 90-94 \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


i. Draw an Ogive and therefrom find $Q3, D_4, and \space P_{47}$ and interpret.
ii. Construct a histogram from the data and find Mode. 

# Determination of First Four Moments from Data

## Problem

Temperature (in degree ceslsius) in Sylhet in first 10 days in May are given below:

29, 31, 30, 32, 30, 31, 28, 29, 34, 33

Find the first four central moments and the corresponding raw moments around 5. 

## Solution

### Theory

rth raw moment around a, $\displaystyle \mu_r'(a) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-a)^r}{n}$

If we denote $d_i = x_i - a$, then

$\displaystyle \mu_r'(a) = \frac{\sum d^r}{n}$

rth central moment, $\displaystyle \mu_r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^r}{n}$

#### Conversion from raw moments to central moments

We can use the binomial expansion. 

For the first moment, we use $(a+b)^1 = a+b$

For the second moment, We use $(a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2$

Similarly the subsequent moments are used to convert the origin moments. We can get the coefficients of binomial expansion from the pascal triangle.

To convert an origin `a` to another origin `k`, i.e. to convert $\mu_r'(a) \space to \space \mu_r'(k)$ 

we let $a^r = \mu_r'(a)$ and $b=a-k$

Thus, to, for example, convert $\mu_2(5)$ to $\mu_2'(8)$ we have

$b=a-k=5-8=-3$

$\mu_2'(8) = \mu_2'(5) + 2\mu_1'(5)b + b^2$

### Calculation

Make a table

### Central Moments

We find using the conversion 

# Determination of Skewness and Kurtosis and Their Types

## Problem

A shrimp producer wanted to get an insight into his shrimp production. To do so, he randomly collected weights of different shrimps in his farm.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
Weight of shrimp (gm) & 10-20 & 20-30 & 30-40 & 40-50 & 50-60 \\ \hline
Frequency & 5 & 8 & 10 & 9 & 4
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

a. Estimate skewness and kurtosis of the data and interpret. 

\newpage

## Solution

### Theory

Coefficient of skewness, $\gamma_1 = \frac{\mu_3}{\sqrt{\mu_2^3}}$

Coefficient of kurtosis, $\gamma_2 = \beta_2 - 3 =  \frac{\mu_4}{\mu_2^2}-3$

# Construction of Box \& Whisker Plot and Five Numbers Summary And Analysis of Their Properties

## Problem

In the asteroid belt in the Solar System, there are estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.9 million objects with a radius above 500 m. The radii of the 25 largest bodies are given below.

\begin{center}
990, 980, 975, 924, 831, 824, 820, 780, 750, 731 \\
700, 700, 675, 658, 653, 609, 570, 515, 500, 466 \\
450, 432, 409, 400, 390
\end{center}

a. Display the data on a box and whisker plot and explain.
b. Determine the five number summary and explain.

## Solution

### Theory

To construct the Box and Whisker plot, we need to find the following values. 

$Median = \frac{n+1}{2}th$ term [since n is odd]

First quartile, $Q_1 = \frac{n+1}{4}th$ term 

Third quartile, $Q_3 = \frac{3(n+1)}{4}th$ term 

We also need to find the inner and outer fences using the Interquartile range (IQR)

$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$

Inner fence: $Q_1 - 1.5 \times IQR$ and $Q_3 + 1.5 \times IQR$

Outer fence: $Q_1 - 3 \times IQR$ and $Q_3 + 3 \times IQR$
